Below are the steps to build the ionic project and run it in a browser.

  Step 1: clone the project

  Step 2: install ionic globally "npm install -g ionic"

  Step 3: install cordova globally "npm install -g cordova"

  Step 3: cd into the project

  Step 4: Run "ionic cordova prepare" in the command line
    - this should prompt you if you want to install project dependencies. Say yes.

  Step 5: Run "npm install" in the command line (only run this if you chose not to install project dependencies from step 4)
